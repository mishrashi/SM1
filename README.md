Using the most recent version of Spring Boot, I'm currently creating a secure authentication system that implements JWT (JSON Web Token) for SM1 authentication. I've developed a login API as part of this configuration that takes a username and password, validates the information, and, following successful authentication, returns a JWT token. I'm using Spring Security to impose access control and safeguard sensitive endpoints in order to provide strong security. I'm simulating login queries with Postman for testing and validation in order to confirm that the token is created and accepted by the secured endpoints. This configuration creates the framework for my application's scalable and safe authentication system.
